    "description": "The project went through a lot of changes and roadblocks, but still came out, not in the shape it was imagined to be in, but it was still done! Throughout the journey, a lot of planning was made for the future in the meantime, deciding what will change and how things will go. You'll learn more about that below.<br><br>Future plans for Direct:<br>Direct will become more of an IGN version of Hello Neighbor. Anyone from the community will be able to send one of our team member's DMs their work, and we will decide if we will release its trailer/teaser/devlog, under some conditions (The trailer/teaser/devlog can still be released on their sites of course). The Direct's team will be sometimes making reviews of either the official games or some fan projects as well, so it's a one review from a whole team, not just one person.There will be more ideas coming forward, so keep your eye out on this page!"

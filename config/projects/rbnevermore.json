What happened to the missing kids? And what is going on with the creepy neighbor? The game will mostly play out like Hello Neighbor 2 but it will not be as linear. The World in Raven Brooks Nevermore is around 2 times the size of the Hello Neighbor 2 Map in which you will be able to explore 2 sides of Raven Brooks:\n\n- Happy and alive in which people live their life as normal, where streets hide secrets just beneath the surface.\n- as well as sad and eerie in which people are scared to even go outside, where the secrets are hidden just behind the fog.\n\nDon't forget that a Demo is Coming in Late 2025.",
